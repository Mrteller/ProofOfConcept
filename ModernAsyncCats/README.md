#  Modern asynchrony demo
The purpose of the project is to illustrate two types of parallel tasks.
In case of "Reload three at once" three processes are run simultaneously but the result is give when all of them are ready.
In case of "Reload three one by one" all asynchronious tasks are run one by one.
